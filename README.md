## Synopsis

This is a WordPress plugin to disable the textedit tab on pages using the BeaverBuilder. To prohibit Editors from clicking the Text Editor
pages already using the Builder. This only disables the default WordPress text editor for WordPress Roles Editor and lower. Administrators
still have access to the Text Editor. 

## Motivation

We had clients with Editor Role and they would accidentally click the Text Editor when the page was build with Beaver Builder and break
the Beaver Builder layouts. The prevents that.

## Installation

Simply download the plugin and install in WordPress plugin directory and Activate the plugin.
